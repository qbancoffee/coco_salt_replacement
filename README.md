# Drop in replacement board for the custom SALT chip on the CoCo's

I am attempting to make a circuit to replace the Supply and Level Translator chip (SALT) that my CoCo 2 uses.
I need one and I can't seem to find a reasonably priced one.

I think I can design a replacement board that does all or most of what the SALT chip did.

## Goals
- [ ] Power regulation with a switching regulator.
- [ ] RS232 capabilities.
- [ ] Zero crossing detector to read cassette data.
- [ ] Cassette relay control.

## Circuit

## 3D rendering
